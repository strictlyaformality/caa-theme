                Children Across America empowers low-income children and families by providing programs that are focused on not only improving a child's educational excellence but also their physical and mental well-being.
                <!-- We partner with local libraries, school systems, healthcare advocates, and hospitals to ensure children have all the tools they need to thrive.
                We believe every child deserves the chance to succeed. We are committed to developing and organizing programs that strengthen children's reading comprehension and technology competencies while engaging them through fun activities including book clubs, educational games, and robotics programming. -->
